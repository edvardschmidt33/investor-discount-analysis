# Mining the market: Premium and discount patterns of Swedish investment firms
This project investigates premium and discount patterns in Swedish
investment firms relative to their net asset value (NAV) and bench-
mark performance to the OMXS30 index. Using historical data
from IBindex and Nasdaq, to perform data preprocessing, pattern
mining (FP-growth), and train classification models (buy/wait) to
evaluate whether large discounts or premiums can help investors
systematically outperform the broader Swedish equity market.
